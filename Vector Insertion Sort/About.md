Includes examples of utilizing the 'insert' and 'erase' methods.
Includes vector declarations, along with the use of methods 'begin' and 'end' for iterator purposes.
Uses nested loops and conditional statements, as well as array structures and the 'sizeof' method.
Displays the use of functions and their declarations, namespaces, and library inclusion (iostream and vectors).
